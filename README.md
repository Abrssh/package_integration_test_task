# package_integration_test_task

A Flutter project test task I was assigned to help with easily integrating packages and plugins to a flutter project by modifying necessary files, like android manifest for google map as an example, adding a demo screen into the main.dart file of the selected project, and running the necessary commands to add the plugins and run it on an emulator using a desktop application.
